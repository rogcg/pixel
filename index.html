<p>welcome to <strong>pixel</strong>. this project consists of a python/lisp based programming language and its compiler.
the intention is help other people to know more of how to create a programming language, and learn contributing, so, at the same time, a new technology is being created.</p>

<h3>
<a name="changes" class="anchor" href="#changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>changes</h3>

<p>primarily, the project was built with <strong>java</strong>. we are rewriting it to <strong>c++</strong> (due to performance issues), and changing the language syntax a little bit. i've got into a good approach for pixel discussing with other folks on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3848718">hacker news</a>, in which the syntax will be changed to a <strong>python</strong> like syntax but with <strong>lisp</strong> like operators. i thought it really interesting, due to the fact that its more easy to be implemented and also it will have a better <em>readable</em> property. please tell me what do you think about this new approach. here is an example of how the syntax will look like. some changes will happen yet, but this is the start.</p>

<pre><code>def main []
    int a1 a2 a3
    str s1 s2
    = a1 10
    = a2 a1
    = a1 (- a2 10)
    = s1 "house"
    real r1 r2 r3
    = r1 (+ (- r3 r2) r3)
    = r2 10.25

    if &gt; a1 a2
        = a3 2
    else
        = a3 29
        = a2 10

    while &lt;= a3 100
        = a3 (+ a3 2)
        = a1 100

    read a1
    read a2
    print "final test"
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="source-code--contribute" class="anchor" href="#source-code--contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>source code | contribute</h3>

<p>there is a stable version in java which consists of the compiler and the analyzers. the source code is available <a href="http://github.com/rogcg/pixellang">here</a>. however, we are reimplementing it to <strong>c++</strong>, so we are rewriting it based on the <strong>java</strong> implementation.</p>

<p>if you want to contribute to this project, clone the source code on github and read the implementation requirements before you start coding.</p>
