{"name":"pixel language","tagline":"a python/lisp like programming language","body":"### welcome to the **pixel language** homepage\r\nwelcome to **pixel**. this project consists of a python/lisp based programming language and its compiler.\r\nthe intention is help other people to know more of how to create a programming language, and learn contributing, so, at the same time, a new technology is being created.\r\n\r\n### changes\r\nprimarily, the project was built with **java**. we are rewriting it to **c++** (due to performance issues), and changing the language syntax a little bit. i've got into a good approach for pixel discussing with other folks on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3848718), in which the syntax will be changed to a **python** like syntax but with **lisp** like operators. i thought it really interesting, due to the fact that its more easy to be implemented and also it will have a better _readable_ property. please tell me what do you think about this new approach. here is an example of how the syntax will look like. some changes will happen yet, but this is the start.\r\n\r\n    def main []\r\n        int a1 a2 a3\r\n        str s1 s2\r\n        = a1 10\r\n        = a2 a1\r\n        = a1 (- a2 10)\r\n        = s1 \"house\"\r\n        real r1 r2 r3\r\n        = r1 (+ (- r3 r2) r3)\r\n        = r2 10.25\r\n \r\n        if > a1 a2\r\n            = a3 2\r\n        else\r\n            = a3 29\r\n            = a2 10\r\n \r\n        while <= a3 100\r\n            = a3 (+ a3 2)\r\n            = a1 100\r\n \r\n        read a1\r\n        read a2\r\n        print \"final test\"\r\n\r\n### source code | contribute\r\nthere is a stable version in java which consists of the compiler and the analyzers. the source code is available [here](http://github.com/rogcg/pixellang). however, we are reimplementing it to **c++**, so we are rewriting it based on the **java** implementation.\r\n\r\nif you want to contribute to this project, clone the source code on github and read the implementation requirements before you start coding.\r\n\r\n### implementation requirements\r\nthe main requirement for pixel now is rewrite the entire compiler from **java** to **c++**. so if you want to contribute just clone this repository and base your implementation based on the [stable code written in java](https://github.com/rogcg/pixellang).\r\n\r\n### authors\r\ncurrently its just me.. my name is roger.\r\n\r\n* [@rogcg](twitter.com/rogcg)\r\n* [rog notes](rogcg.com)\r\n* [google+](plus.google.com/+RogerCÃ¢mara)\r\n\r\n**btw, i like text in lower case.**\r\n\r\n[pixel language on google plus](https://plus.google.com/100494143910868751778)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
