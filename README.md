pixel language
=====

this is the repository for pixel language.

i'm reimplementing the compiler from java to c++. if you want to get the last 
version of it (which is written in java) get it [here](http://github.com/rogcg/pixellang). 

remember that i'm rewriting the project to c++ based on the java implementation, so please,
if you are going to contribute, base on the java code. as soon as the c++ version is stable, 
the java version will be deleted.

check the website.
